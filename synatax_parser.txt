Syntax parser is simply just a program thats job is to read your character by character.
for example: 

function hello() {
    console.log("Hello!);
}

hello();

in that above code synatax parser is reading your code character by character like it is starting parsing like: 'f' 'u' 'n' 'c' 't' 'i' 'o' 'n'  oh yes, thats a function 
there should be space after it. then i see name of that function up until parenthesis and after that so and so on!

The code you write in javascript is not what directly telling computer what to do. its being translated 
from what you've written to what a harder understands easily!

That program ( a compiler ) do the work of synatx parsing like it goes through your code 
character by character and checking if that syntax is valid or not if so, then it allows it to 
be translated in such a way that it is easily to be implemented to computer hardware for the desired output!
